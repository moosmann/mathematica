\section{Introduction}

The idea of a nontrivial ground state being responsible 
for the emergence of `elementary' particles is a rather old 
one: Already Lord Kelvin proposed 
that atoms and molecules should be considered 
knotted lines of vortices representing distortions in 
a universal medium (or ground state) -- the ether \cite{Kelvin}. As we know now, 
the physis of atoms and molecules turned out to 
be describable in terms of a much more efficient and elegant framework: Quantum
mechanics. The agent responsible for the 
chemical bond -- Kelvin's electron -- considered a spinning point 
particle in quantum mechanics, and this yields an 
excellent description in atomic physics, 
collider physics, and the bulk of situations in 
condensed matter physics.  

There are, however, discrepancies with the 
concept of the electron being a point particle, and there are 
exceptional experimental situations pointing to the limitations of this 
concept to describe reality. As for the former, we have in 
mind the old problem of a diverging classical 
selfenergy not solved in quantum 
electrodynamics where the electron mass is introduced 
as a free parameter whose running with 
resolution depends on experimental input. On the other 
hand, the two-dimensional dynamics of strongly 
correlated electrons in condensed matter physics signals  
the relevance of nonlocal effects possibly related to the 
nontrivial anatomy of the electron 
\cite{Muller1986,Anderson2005}. Also, recent 
high-temperature plasma experiments indicate 
unexpected explosive behavior not unlikely 
related to an unconventional mechanism for the 
emergence of leptons, see \cite{Zpinch} and 
references therein. 

Recent developments in understanding the 
confining phase of an SU(2) Yang-Mills 
theory suggest that Kelvin's 
ideas may actually be realized in 
Nature, see \cite{FaddeevNiemi}. While the authors of 
\cite{FaddeevNiemi} construct a plausible effective low-energy action for the 
4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory with solutions to the associated field
equations representing closed confining strings 
knotted into stable solitons 
the thermodynamical approach of 
\cite{Hofmann2005} relates the emergence 
of magnetic center-vortex loops 
to discontinuous phase changes 
of a complex order parameter 
across the (downward) Hagedorn 
transition and the fact that no magnetic 
charges exist in the confining low-temperature 
phase where these flux lines could end. Also, it was discussed in
\cite{Hofmann2005} how the 
locations of selfintersection represent 
isolated, spinning magnetic charges. 

In our previous article \cite{MH2008} we have 
investigated 
the sector with $N=0$ selfintersections by 
considering a resolution dependent 
ensemble average with a weight-functional for 
the individual center-vortex loop which is 
defined purely in terms of the planar curves's 
geometry. The resolution dependence of the 
latter, in turn, is determined by a 
curve-shrinking equation (heat-equation) \cite{GageHamilton,Grayson} 
whose validity to describe the spatial 
coarse-graining of a single curve is motivated from considerations
relating local curvature with the direction and speed of `motion' of the associated 
line-segment. The requirement that 
the partition function over a given ensemble of 
planar curves is invariant under a change of 
the resolution then yields the 
renormalization-group evolution 
of the weight-functional which is written as the exponential 
of an `action'. Here the term `action' is slightly misleading 
since we do not aim at describing the time-evolution of the 
system by demanding stationarity of the `action' under curve variation. 
To do the latter, a model, which 
relates resolution and time, needs to be introduced. We thus 
regard resolution as the more fundamental quantity than time 
to describe subatomic systems. Our observation 
is that the weight exhibits a transition 
towards dilational invariance after a 
finite, critical decrease of resolution. 
On average, center-vortex loops are shrunk to circular 
points for a resolution less than the critical value which defacto removes them 
from the spectrum and thus generates an asymptotic mass gap\footnote{Center-vortex
  loops with $N>0$ are massive \cite{Hofmann2005,Hofmann2007}.}. Knowing
the evolution of the weight-functional, one is in a position to compute
the resolution dependence of `observables' as ensemble averages of the
associated (nonlocal or local) `operators'. As for the evolution 
of the initially sharp center-of-mass position, 
we observe a spread of the variance with decreasing resolution
saturating at a finite value. This is 
similar to the unitary free-particle evolution of a position eigenstate
in quantum mechanics.      

The purpose of the present article is to extend the procedure 
of \cite{MH2008} to the case of $N=1$. In this case, there is a 
singled-out point on the curve: the location of 
the selfintersection where practically the entire mass of the soliton
resides \cite{Hofmann2005}. Setting the Yang-Mills 
scale of the SU(2) theory equal to the electron mass $m_e=511\,$keV,
which in turn determines the mass of the intersection point, 
we interprete this soliton as the electron or positron 
\cite{ZPinch,Hofmann2007}. In the presence of a static 
electric or magnetic background field it is physically possible to lift
the two-fold degeneracy w.r.t. the two possible directions of
center-flux: The soliton exhibits a two-fold spin degeneracy. 
Notice that as long 
as both wings of center flux are of finite size the 
position of the intersection point can be shifted 
at almost no cost of energy. In particular, 
if at the intersection the inner 
angle $\theta$ between in- and out-going 
center-flux is sufficiently small then a motion along the 
normal to the flux line can easily generate a velocity 
of the intersection point exceeding the speed of light, see
Fig.\,\ref{Fig-1}. Recall, that the path-integral formulation of quantum
mechanics admits superluminal motion.    

The paper is organized as follows. 

\section{Conceptual framework}

The transition from the non-selfintersecting to the selfintersecting CVL sector 
is proceeded by twisting of non-selfinteresecting curves.
Since in a one-fold twisted curve the direction of the fluxes of each loop 
are parallel at the intersection point, a localized magnetic (anti)monopole 
can't emerge because no kinetic energy from the (anti)monopoles which are 
circulating in the tube can be transferred to the monopole at the intersection. 
Thus a second twist is needed to create a (anti)monopole, as shown in Fig.\, \ref{Fig-1}.
To localize the magnetic monopole in the intermediate loop the repulsion due to Biot-Savart law has to be overcome.
Despite the signifcant physical distinction there's no need to distinguish 
between a one- and two-fold intersection, since the direction of the flux is irrelevant in the process of curve shrinking.

Notice that by immersing an $N=0$ CVL of an isolated SU(2) Yang-Mills theory into a 
flat 2D surface at $m_D<\infty$, $d>0$, a hypothetical observer measuring a positive (negative) 
curvature of a sector of the vortex line experiences more (less)
negative pressure in the intermediate vicinity of this curve sector 
leading to its motion towards (away from)
the observer, see Fig.\,\ref{Fig-1}.

$P_e$ thus leading to a motion of the sector along $\vec{n}$.}
\end{figure}
%************************ 
The speed of this 
motion will be a monotonic function of curvature. 
On average, this shrinks the CVL. Alternatively, one may {\sl globally}
consider the limit 
$m_D\to\infty$,$d\to 0$,
that is, the confining phase of an SU(2) Yang-Mills theory, 
but now take into account the effects of an environment which 
{\sl locally} relaxes this limit (by collisions) and thus also induces
curve shrinking. This situation is described by the 
following equation for a flow in the (dimensionless) parameter 
$\tau$    
%*********
\eqb
\label{CSt}
\partial_\tau \vec{x}=\frac{1}{\sigma}\,\partial^2_s \vec{x}\,,
\eqe
%**********
where $s$ is arc length, $\vec{x}$ is a point on the CVL in the plane, and 
$\sigma$ is a string tension effectively 
expressing the disortions induced by the environment. After a rescaling,
$\hat{x}\equiv\sqrt{\sigma}\vec{x}$, $\xi=\sqrt{\sigma}s$,
Eq.\,(\ref{CSt}) assumes the following form
%*********
\eqb
\label{CSta}
\partial_\tau \hat{x}(u,\tau)=\partial^2_\xi \hat{x}=k(u,\tau)\vec{n}(u,\tau)\,,
\eqe
%**********
where $u$ is a (dimensionless) curve parameter, $\vec{n}$ 
the (inward-pointing) Euclidean unit normal, $k$ the
scalar curvature, defined as 
%*********
\eqb
\label{curvdef}
k\equiv\left|\partial^2_\xi \hat{x}\right|
=\left|\frac{1}{|\partial_u\hat{x}|}\partial_u\left(\frac{1}{|\partial_u\hat{x}|}\partial_u\hat{x}\right)\right|\,,
\eqe
%**********
$|\vec{v}|\equiv\sqrt{\vec{v}\cdot\vec{v}}$, and $\vec{v}\cdot\vec{w}$ 
denotes the Euclidean scalar product of the vectors $\vec{v}$ and
$\vec{w}$. In the following we resort to a slight abuse of notation by
using the same symbol $\hat{x}$ for the functional dependence on $u$ or
$\xi$. 


We now consider curves with one selfintersection, so called figure eights 
which are defined to have only one double point and winding number zero $\int k ds = 0$.
In contrast to the non-intersecting case where smooth curves embedded in a plane 
shrink to a point under the flow for $\tau \nearrow T$, so that 
the limiting shape is a circle and the isoperimetric ratio converges to $4\pi$, 
in the case of figure eights the isoperimetric ratio is bounded for 
$\tau \nearrow T$ only if the two areas enclosed by the curve are of unequal length. 
The curve stays smooth until the flow encounters a singularity 
that is when the area of one of the loops vanishes \cite{GraysonII}. As in the 
twisted case where the derivative of the area with respect to the flow parameter $\tau$ 
is given by $2\pi$ there exists an invariant under the flow but which is now given 
by the difference of the two areas enclosed by the curve. The $\tau$ derivative 
of the total area now is bounded between $-4\pi$ and $-2\pi$. 

We now wish to interprete curve-shrinking as a Wilsonian
renormalization-group flow taking place in the $N=1$ 
planar CVL sector. A partition function, 
defined as a statistical average (according to a suitably defined weight) over $N=1$ 
CVLs, is to be left invariant under a decrease of the 
resolution determined by the flow parameter $\tau$. 
Notice that, physically, $\tau$ is interpreted as a strictly
monotonic decreasing (dimensionless) 
function of a ratio $\frac{Q}{Q_0}$ where $Q$ ($Q_0$) are mass 
scales associated with an actual (initial) resolution applied to the
system. 

To device a geometric ansatz for the 
effective action $S=S[\hat{x}(\tau)]$, which is a functional of the
curve $\hat{x}$ representable in terms 
of integrals over local densities in $\xi$ (reparametrization
invariance), 
the following reflection on symmetries is in order.  
(i) scaling symmetry $\hat{x}\to \lambda\hat{x}\,,\ \ \lambda\in{\mathbf
  R}_+$: For both, $\lambda\to\infty$ and $\lambda\to 0$, implying
$\lambda L\to\infty$ and $\lambda L\to 0$ at fixed $L$, the action $S$ should 
be invariant under further finite rescalings (decoupling of the fixed
length scale $\sigma^{-1/2}$), 
(ii) Euclidean point symmetry of the plane (rotations, translations
and reflections about a given axis): Sufficient but not necessary for
this is a 
representation of $S$ in terms of integrals over 
scalar densities w.r.t. these 
symmetries. That is, the action density should be expressible as a
series involving products of Euclidean scalar products of $\frac{\partial^n}{\partial
    \xi^n}\hat{x}\,,\ \ n\in\mathbf{N}_+\,,$ or constancy. 
However, an exceptional scalar integral over a nonscalar density can be 
deviced. Consider the area $A$, calculated as 
%*********
\eqb
\label{area}
A=\left|\frac12\,\int_0^{2\pi} d\xi\,\hat{x}\cdot\vec{n}\right|\,.
\eqe
%*********  
The density $\hat{x}\cdot\vec{n}$ in Eq.\,(\ref{area}) is not a scalar under
translations. 

We now resort to a 
factorization ansatz as 
%*********
\eqb
\label{effectactdef}
S=F_c\times F_{nc}\,,
\eqe
%**********
where in addition to
Euclidean point symmetry $F_c$ ($F_{nc}$) is (is not) invariant 
under $\hat{x}\to \lambda\hat{x}$. In principle, 
infinitely many operators can be defined 
to contribute to $F_c$. Since the 
evolution generates circles for $\tau\nearrow T$ higher derivatives of 
$k$ w.r.t. $\xi$ rapidly converge to zero \cite{GageHamilton}. We expect this to be true 
also for Euclidean scalar products involving higher 
derivatives $\frac{\partial^n}{\partial \xi^n}\hat{x}$. 
To yield conformally invariant expressions such integrals need to be 
multiplied by powers of $\sqrt{A}$ and/or $L$ or the inverse of 
integrals involving lower derivatives. At this stage, we are 
not capable of constraining the expansion in derivatives by additional physical or
mathematical arguments. To be pragmatic, 
we simply set $F_c$ equal to the isoperimetric ratio:
%*********
\eqb
\label{explFc}
F_c(\tau)\equiv\frac{L(\tau)^2}{A(\tau)}\,.
\eqe
%*********
We conceive the nonconformal factor $F_{nc}$ in $S$ as a formal expansion in inverse powers of 
$L$. Since we regard the renormalization-group evolution of the
effective action as induced by the flow of an ensemble of curves, where the evolution of each member is
dictated by Eq.\,(\ref{CSta}), we allow for an explicit $\tau$
dependence of the coefficient $c$ of the lowest nontrivial power
$\frac{1}{L}$. In principle, this sums up the contribution to $F_{nc}$ of certain 
higher-power operators which do not exhibit an explicit $\tau$
dependence. Hence we make the following ansatz
%********
\eqb
\label{explFnc}
F_{nc}(\tau)=1+\frac{c(\tau)}{L(\tau)}\,.
\eqe
%*******
The initial value $c(\tau=0)$ is determined from a physical 
boundary condition such as the mean length $\bar{L}$ at $\tau=0$ which determines
the mean mass $\bar{m}$ of a CVL as $\bar{m}=\sigma\bar{L}$. 


\section{Results of simulation}

The ensembles $E_M$ under consideration are build up of the $M$ initial curves 
depicted in Fig.\,\ref{Fig-2}, where all curves have a total area of $200\pi$. Since the $\tau$ value $T$ at which one 
of the areas enclosed by the curve diminishes and the flow encounters 
a singularity varies from curve to curve, we now considers several ensembles $E_M$ for $M$ fixed with differently ordered curves. In the first class of ensembles the curves are ordered with decreasing $T$. The others classes are in arbritrary order.
